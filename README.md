Description/Purpose: For this project, I have created a fake bank system. With this project, I have worked more on 
appearance as well as functionality. Just like the previous project, there are some pages and functions that users
must register with the site to be able to see and use. This project also uses data tables created in phpmyadmin. 
Among its functionality, users are able to register as a member of this made up bank and log into the site where they 
will have access to additional pages and functions only logged in users can see.

Dependencies: This project depends on data tables created in phpmyadmin, and the ccuresearch server which hosts this 
webpage.

Usage: This project can be used to view a bank webpage and use some of its functionalities, which includes registering 
as a user, and depositing and withdrawing money. You can also choose what type of account you wish to open.

Future Work: For future work, I would like to be able to enable email verification for this site where an email
message is sent once a user is registered. I am still having issues with that. Also, I would like to input an 
a function that allows users to open additional accounts without having create another profile.

Major and Project Relation: I am an Information Systems major with a minor in Graphic Design. One field that employees
in this field work in is webpage development and functionality.
